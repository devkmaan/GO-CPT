# Storyvord - Task

## Description
Storyvord - Task is a web application cloned from a Figma file. 

### Project Overview
Welcome to my project where I convert a detailed Figma design into a functional frontend codebase. The goal of this project is to create a responsive and interactive web interface that faithfully reflects the provided design specifications. I use HTML, Tailwind CSS, and React to achieve a modern and dynamic user experience.

### Key Objectives

#### Design Handoff:
I start by thoroughly reviewing and understanding the Figma design provided by the design team.
My focus is on accurately interpreting all design elements such as colors, fonts, and layout to ensure they are properly implemented.

#### Technology Stack:
HTML: For structuring the web content.
Tailwind CSS: For styling and ensuring a responsive design.
React: For building interactive UI components and managing state.

#### Responsive Design:
I ensure that the layout adapts to various devices and screen sizes, providing a consistent and usable experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

#### Interactivity:
I integrate interactive elements as specified in the Figma design, including buttons, sliders, and other user inputs.
React is used to create dynamic UI components and manage state.

#### Testing and Validation:
I conduct thorough testing to identify and fix any bugs.
My goal is to validate that the implementation meets all design requirements and performs well.
I use both manual and automated testing techniques to ensure functionality and design accuracy.

#### Deliverables
A fully functional frontend codebase that accurately replicates the Figma design.
